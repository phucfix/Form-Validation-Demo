# Form Validation demo

A browser form which collects Email, Country, Postal Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means validating as you type, not only upon form submission. When a field is invalid, it is highlighted in red and show an error message to guide the user.
